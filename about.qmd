**Let's forget ...**

Hey folks, My name is Saied Alimoradi. I'm a professional Machine Learning Engineer with over 4 years of experience in AI and Data Science. Currently, I work at [DataCoLab](https://datacolab.co.uk/) Company, where I employ my skills to solve complex problems and develop innovative solutions.

I am the founder of [Khodnevis](https://khodnevisai.com/), which is the first Persian AI copywriter. This project signifies my passion for blending AI technology with language and communication, creating a unique platform that supports Persian content creation.

In addition to my work in AI and Data Science, I have also worked  in MLOps, focusing on the deployment of AI model's lifecycle. This experience has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of AI implementation, enabling me to streamline processes and enhance efficiency in my projects.

I am always open to collaboration and new opportunities. Feel free to contact me at `saied.alimoradi@gmail.com` for any inquiries or potential projects. I look forward to connecting with you!
